Rules of Farkle:

    Each player must sign up for the game with a name.
    A minimum of 2 players is required to start the game.

    The game is played with 6 dice. Each player takes turns rolling the dice.
    Players roll all 6 dice and score points based on the combinations rolled.

    After each roll, players may choose to keep certain dice. However, they must keep at least one 
    scoring die or face a penalty known as a Farkle, resulting in losing all points for that turn.
    Players can choose to stop rolling at any time and keep the points accumulated for that turn.
    If all 6 dice are used to score points, the player must roll all 6 dice at least one more time.

    The game continues until one player reaches 10,000 points.
    The player who reaches 10,000 points first is declared the winner.
    After a player reaches 10,000 points, all other players have one more turn to try to beat the 
    leading player's score.

    There will be an entry round for each player to roll the dice and determine the order of play.
    Each player must score 1000 points in a single turn to get on the board and begin accumulating points.

Scoring Rules:

    1s are worth 100 points each.
    5s are worth 50 points each.
    Three of a kind is worth 100 times the face value of the dice (e.g., three 2s are worth 200 points).
    Three 1s are worth 1000 points.
